# Spelling of Dependent and Dependant

## Context and Problem Statement

Be consistent in the spelling of **dependent** and **dependant**. Decide whether to use the British or American usage. SchemaCrawler deals with dependent tables and dependent objects.

The difference between **dependent** and **dependant** comes down to spelling and usage:
- **Dependent** is the standard spelling in **American English** for both the noun and adjective.
- **Dependant** is more common in **British English**, but only as a noun.

### Usage:
- **Dependent (adjective)**: "Her success is **dependent** on hard work."
- **Dependent (noun, American English)**: "He listed his children as **dependents** on his tax return."
- **Dependant (noun, British English)**: "She has three **dependants** who rely on her financial support."


## Considered Options

1. Use the American style, and spell everything "dependent".
2. Use the British convention.
3. Use the British convention, but treat "dependant object" as a compound noun, and "dependent table", where "dependent" is as an adjective for the noun "table.


## Decision Outcome

Option #3 - use the British convention, and use "dependant object" but "dependent table".
